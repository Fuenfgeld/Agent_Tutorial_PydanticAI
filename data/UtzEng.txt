Summary

The inpatient admission of your patient was for continuation of chemotherapy with Taxol and Carboplatin (4th cycle) for a known underlying condition.
Upon admission, there were no clinical indications of disease progression.
On July 1, 2020, the patient received Paclitaxel 200 mg/m² BSA (total dose: 382.5 mg) over 5 hours and Carboplatin (AUC 5) 590 mg over 2 hours with the corresponding supportive medication. The therapy was well tolerated.
The leukocytosis observed after chemotherapy was primarily attributed to corticosteroids, as there were no clinical signs of infection.

We were able to discharge the patient in good general condition on July 2, 2020.

Relevant Findings

Dermatological admission status: Skin surface normal, skin turgor normal, minimal pigmentation, diffuse alopecia of the scalp. Multiple nevi without suspicion (MNZN) on the trunk and extremities. Several subcutaneous nodules on the abdomen and back (known lipomas).
